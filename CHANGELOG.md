## [Unreleased]

### Added (Unreleased)

- `@ottabase/ottarouter` package: zero-dependency Cloudflare Workers router with order-free precedence (static >
  `:param` > `*`, exact method > `ALL`), prefix-scoped onion middleware, gated sub-router mounts, and null-based
  fall-through for composing with custom routes, shortlinks, and static assets.
- otta-web: security-context membership lookups (org + group) are now cached behind a 5-minute KV read-through cache
  (`auth:usr:{id}:member-orgs` / `member-groups:*`, same TTL as the RBAC cache), replacing 2–4 D1 queries per
  authenticated request with KV reads. New `invalidateMembershipCache()` helper (`worker/lib/auth-utils.ts`) invalidates
  eagerly on every in-app mutation path: sign-in invite activation, admin member invite/update/remove, organization
  creation, and generic CRUD on `user_groups`/`user_group_members`. KV failures fall back to direct D1 — caching never
  weakens membership enforcement. See docs/CACHE_KEYS.md.

### Changed (Unreleased)

- otta-web worker routing migrated from the hand-rolled `resolveApiRoute` if/regex chain to declarative
  `@ottabase/ottarouter` registrations (`worker/routes/router.ts`); route handlers, endpoint paths, and the
  `ottabase/config.routes.ts` custom-route contract are unchanged.
- otta-web bootstrap gate: `resolvePlatformState` now has a READY fast path — per-isolate memo (60s soft TTL) plus a
  KV=READY early return — eliminating the serialized KV read + D1 probe every request (including asset fetches)
  previously paid. State writers drop the memo on any transition away from READY; a re-init on a live deployment should
  expect up to ~2 minutes of stale READY traffic from remote isolates (memo TTL + KV propagation). The preemptive
  KV=READY+dead-D1 panic/maintenance mode was removed as part of this: `PlatformStateResult.panic` is currently always
  `false` and D1 failures surface in the actual queries.
- otta-web worker bundle is now minified with source maps uploaded (`minify` + `upload_source_maps` in wrangler.jsonc):
  upload size 3604→1742 KiB raw, 684→478 KiB gzip.
- otta-web frontend: removed the `mantine` manual chunk from `vite.config.ts` — it was `modulepreload`ed into every page
  (~55 KB gzip fetched+executed on first paint) although Mantine is only used by the lazy `/demo/mantine` route.
  First-load JS drops from ~330 to ~297 KB gzip; Mantine now lives entirely inside the demo route chunk.

### Fixed (Unreleased)

- otta-web: creating an organization no longer leaves the creator unable to use it (the security-context cache populated
  earlier in the same request is now invalidated after the owner membership is created).

### Security (Unreleased)

- otta-web: all in-app membership mutations (admin routes, sign-in invite activation, org creation, generic CRUD on
  group memberships) eagerly invalidate the new membership cache so revocations take effect on the next request; only
  mutations made outside the app (custom code, direct D1 edits) fall back to the 300s TTL plus KV eventual consistency
  (~6 minutes worst case cross-colo) as the bound on retained access.

  initial public release.
- Going forward, `Unreleased` and version sections should capture externally relevant changes only.
