## [Unreleased]

### Added (Unreleased)

- `@ottabase/ottarouter` package: zero-dependency Cloudflare Workers router with order-free precedence (static >
  `:param` > `*`, exact method > `ALL`), prefix-scoped onion middleware, gated sub-router mounts, and null-based
  fall-through for composing with custom routes, shortlinks, and static assets.
- otta-web: security-context membership lookups (org + group) are now cached behind a 5-minute KV read-through cache
  (`auth:usr:{id}:member-orgs` / `member-groups:*`, same TTL as the RBAC cache), replacing 2–4 D1 queries per
  authenticated request with KV reads. New `invalidateMembershipCache()` helper (`worker/lib/auth-utils.ts`) invalidates
  eagerly on every in-app mutation path: sign-in invite activation, admin member invite/update/remove, organization
  creation, and generic CRUD on `user_groups`/`user_group_members`. KV failures fall back to direct D1 — caching never
  weakens membership enforcement. See docs/CACHE_KEYS.md.
- brand-engine / otta-web: edge→client brand config hydration handoff — the Cloudflare Worker now injects the full
  resolved brand config as a JSON `<script type="application/json">` tag (`buildInitialConfigScriptTag`) alongside the
  existing critical CSS, and `BrandProvider` hydrates from it instead of re-fetching `/api/brand` on mount. Removes a
  redundant round-trip and, more importantly, guarantees the client can never resolve a config that disagrees with what
  the edge already painted.

### Changed (Unreleased)

- otta-web worker routing migrated from the hand-rolled `resolveApiRoute` if/regex chain to declarative
  `@ottabase/ottarouter` registrations (`worker/routes/router.ts`); route handlers, endpoint paths, and the
  `ottabase/config.routes.ts` custom-route contract are unchanged.
- otta-web bootstrap gate: `resolvePlatformState` now has a READY fast path — per-isolate memo (60s soft TTL) plus a
  KV=READY early return — eliminating the serialized KV read + D1 probe every request (including asset fetches)
  previously paid. State writers drop the memo on any transition away from READY; a re-init on a live deployment should
  expect up to ~2 minutes of stale READY traffic from remote isolates (memo TTL + KV propagation). The preemptive
  KV=READY+dead-D1 panic/maintenance mode was removed as part of this: `PlatformStateResult.panic` is currently always
  `false` and D1 failures surface in the actual queries.
- otta-web worker bundle is now minified with source maps uploaded (`minify` + `upload_source_maps` in wrangler.jsonc):
  upload size 3604→1742 KiB raw, 684→478 KiB gzip.
- otta-web frontend: removed the `mantine` manual chunk from `vite.config.ts` — it was `modulepreload`ed into every page
  (~55 KB gzip fetched+executed on first paint) although Mantine is only used by the lazy `/demo/mantine` route.
  First-load JS drops from ~330 to ~297 KB gzip; Mantine now lives entirely inside the demo route chunk.
- brand-engine: worker HTML injection now resolves the brand config once per request — new `resolveConfigFromFull`
  derives path-scoped light/dark themes (route token overrides included) from an already-resolved full config, pure CPU
  with no extra KV/D1 access, replacing a prior two-call pattern that doubled KV reads on every hard navigation.
- otta-web: brand-config `appId` resolution for edge HTML injection now sources from the worker's own configured app id
  (matching the client's static `APP_ID`) instead of a `?appId=`/`X-App-Id` request hint, which a normal document
  navigation never carries anyway; the injected payload also carries that `appId` so a deployment-time `APP_ID` env
  override can't cause a later `refresh()`/fetch to swap in a different app's brand mid-session.
- otta-web: HTML responses carrying injected brand config now set `Cache-Control: no-store` and drop
  `ETag`/`Last-Modified` — previously the injected response reused the static asset's original validators, so a browser
  could 304-revalidate and keep serving a stale embedded theme indefinitely after an admin brand-kit update.
- brand-engine: deleted the now-unused `resolveBrandConfig` persistence function (superseded by
  `resolveFullBrandConfig` + `resolveConfigFromFull`); `warmBrandCache`'s `skipCache` option renamed to `skipCacheRead`
  and the post-invalidation re-warm now actually writes the freshly resolved config back to KV (previously the same flag
  skipped the write too, making the "warm" a no-op).

### Fixed (Unreleased)

- otta-web: creating an organization no longer leaves the creator unable to use it (the security-context cache populated
  earlier in the same request is now invalidated after the owner membership is created).
- otta-web: fixed a document-corruption bug in brand HTML injection where tenant-authored brand text (tagline,
  `customCss`) containing `$'`, `` $` ``, or `$$` could be expanded by `String.replace`'s special replacement-pattern
  handling, splicing arbitrary trailing document content into `<head>`; the injector now uses a replacer function.
- brand-engine: fixed the `.dark` critical CSS silently falling back to the light palette on KV cache hits — the
  resolved dark theme was dropped by the cache-hit code path, so dark-mode users on a warm cache first-painted the light
  palette until client-side hydration corrected it.

### Security (Unreleased)

- otta-web: all in-app membership mutations (admin routes, sign-in invite activation, org creation, generic CRUD on
  group memberships) eagerly invalidate the new membership cache so revocations take effect on the next request; only
  mutations made outside the app (custom code, direct D1 edits) fall back to the 300s TTL plus KV eventual consistency
  (~6 minutes worst case cross-colo) as the bound on retained access.
- otta-web: brand config JSON embedded inline in HTML (the new hydration handoff) is escaped for `<`, `>`, `&`, and
  U+2028/U+2029 before embedding, so tenant-controlled brand text cannot prematurely close the `<script>` tag or
  otherwise break out of the JSON payload.

  initial public release.
- Going forward, `Unreleased` and version sections should capture externally relevant changes only.
